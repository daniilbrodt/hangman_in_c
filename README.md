# Description

Hangman here is a game where you play a guessing game against computer where a player selects a difficulty (number of guesses) and length of the word, and computer picks randomly the word of a given length and stores it as a secret word. Player can see only underscores instead of letters, but by guessing corrects letters, the underscores are substituted by letters that are in the secret word.
